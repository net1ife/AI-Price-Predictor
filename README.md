To create a README file for the `gainz.py` and `gainzv2.py` programs, you can follow the template below:

# Gainz.py and Gainzv2.py

This repository contains two Python programs, `gainz.py` and `gainzv2.py`, which use LSTM models to predict price movements in the stock market based on historical data.

## Prerequisites

To run the programs, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- yfinance
- scikit-learn
- torch
- ta (Technical Analysis Library)

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy yfinance scikit-learn torch ta
```

## Usage

### gainz.py

1. Open the `gainz.py` file.
2. Modify the `tickers`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `seq_length`, `input_dim`, `hidden_dim`, `num_layers`, `output_dim`, `num_epochs`, and `learning_rate` variables according to your needs.
3. Run the script using the command: `python gainz.py`.

The program will download historical stock data using Yahoo Finance, normalize the data, train an LSTM model, and predict the next day's stock prices. The predicted prices will be printed on the console.

### gainzv2.py

1. Open the `gainzv2.py` file.
2. Modify the `ticker`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `seq_length`, `hidden_dim`, `num_layers`, `num_epochs`, and `learning_rate` variables according to your needs.
3. Run the script using the command: `python gainzv2.py`.

The program will download historical stock data using Yahoo Finance, normalize the data, train an LSTM model, and predict the next day's stock prices. The predicted prices will be printed on the console.

## Additional Notes

- Both programs utilize LSTM models for predicting stock prices.
- `gainz.py` uses the `MinMaxScaler` from scikit-learn for data normalization.
- `gainzv2.py` uses the `MinMaxScaler` from scikit-learn for data normalization and the `ta` library for technical analysis feature calculation.
- The programs are set to predict price movements for the SPY (S&P 500 ETF) stock by default. You can modify the ticker symbol to predict prices for other stocks.
- The start_date variable in both programs determines the starting point of historical data.
- The end_date variable in both programs is set to the current date by default.
- The programs are designed to run on either CPU or GPU (if available) based on the device availability.

Feel free to explore and modify the programs to suit your needs!

## Disclaimer

These programs provide predictions based on historical data and should not be considered financial advice. The predictions may not reflect actual market behavior, and investing in the stock market involves risks. Always do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions.
